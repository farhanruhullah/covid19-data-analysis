# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis using SQL & Tableau

This project involves an in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQL for data exploration and Tableau for interactive data visualization. The goal is to understand trends in infection, death rates, population-level impacts, and vaccine distribution across countries and continents.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

- Analyzed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations using SQL.
- Visualized global and country-specific trends with Tableau.
- Used SQL techniques like CTEs, temp tables, views, and aggregate functions.
- Delivered insights on infection rates, mortality, and vaccine rollouts.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server** – Data exploration and transformation
- **Tableau** – Dashboard for visualization
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data source formatting and integration

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- **Infection Rate vs. Population** – % of population infected per country
- **Death Rate vs. Total Cases** – Mortality rate among confirmed cases
- **Top Countries by Deaths** – Highest total deaths by country and continent
- **Vaccination Progress** – Rolling count of vaccinated people per country
- **Global Summary Metrics** – Total cases, deaths, and overall fatality rate

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load the COVID-19 datasets (deaths and vaccinations) into SQL Server.
2. Run the SQL queries to analyze trends, rates, and distributions.
3. Use CTEs, temp tables, and views for structured calculations.
4. Import final results into Tableau to build and publish the dashboard.

## 📌 Insights Discovered

- Some countries experienced infection rates over 20% of their population.
- The global average death rate among confirmed cases was around 2–3%.
- Europe and the Americas reported the highest total deaths.
- Vaccine rollouts varied significantly across countries and continents.
